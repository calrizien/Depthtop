# Device Anchor Fix - Critical for RemoteImmersiveSpace Rendering

## Problem
The application was experiencing the following critical error when trying to render content in Vision Pro's RemoteImmersiveSpace:

```
Presenting a drawable without a device anchor. This drawable won't be presented.
```

This resulted in a black screen with no content visible in the immersive space, despite the render loop running and processing frames correctly.

## Root Cause
The `deviceAnchor` property on `LayerRenderer.Drawable` must be set before presenting the drawable to CompositorServices. This anchor represents the user's head pose (position and orientation) in 3D space and is essential for:

1. **Spatial Synchronization**: Aligning rendered content with the user's physical head movements
2. **Stereoscopic Rendering**: Correctly positioning content for each eye
3. **Frame Presentation**: CompositorServices refuses to present drawables without a valid device anchor

## The Fix

### 1. Enable World Tracking on macOS
Previously, world tracking was only initialized on visionOS. For RemoteImmersiveSpace on macOS, we need ARKit world tracking with the remote device:

**File**: `DepthtopApp+Render.swift`
```swift
// BEFORE (incorrect - visionOS only):
#if os(visionOS)
await renderData.setUpWorldTracking()
#endif

// AFTER (correct - both platforms):
await renderData.setUpWorldTracking()
```

### 2. Set Device Anchor on Drawable
The device anchor must be queried from ARKit's WorldTrackingProvider and set on every drawable before presentation:

**File**: `RenderData+Render.swift`
```swift
// Query device anchor at the correct presentation time
let time = LayerRenderer.Clock.Instant.epoch.duration(to: drawable.frameTiming.presentationTime).timeInterval
let deviceAnchor = worldTracking.queryDeviceAnchor(atTimestamp: time)

// CRITICAL: Set the anchor on the drawable
if let deviceAnchor = deviceAnchor {
    drawable.deviceAnchor = deviceAnchor
    logger.debug("[RENDER] Device anchor set for frame")
} else {
    logger.warning("[RENDER] No device anchor available - drawable won't be presented properly")
}
```

### 3. Use Device Anchor in View Matrices
View matrices must incorporate the device anchor transform to properly position content:

**File**: `RenderData+Render.swift`
```swift
if let deviceAnchor = drawable.deviceAnchor {
    // Combine device anchor transform with per-eye view transform
    for view in drawable.views {
        let deviceTransform = deviceAnchor.originFromAnchorTransform
        let viewTransform = view.transform
        matrices.append((deviceTransform * viewTransform).inverse)
    }
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **RemoteImmersiveSpace Requirements**: When rendering from macOS to Vision Pro, the same spatial tracking requirements apply as native visionOS apps.

2. **ARKitSession with Remote Device**: On macOS, the ARKitSession must be initialized with the remote device identifier:
   ```swift
   session = context.remoteDeviceIdentifier.map { ARKitSession(device: $0) }
   ```

3. **Timing is Critical**: The device anchor must be queried at the exact presentation time of the frame to ensure proper synchronization.

4. **Platform Differences**: While the setup differs slightly between macOS and visionOS, both platforms require proper device anchor handling for spatial rendering.

## Testing the Fix
After implementing these changes:
1. Clean build the project to ensure Metal shaders are recompiled
2. Run the app and connect Vision Pro
3. Enable the immersive space
4. Content should now render properly in 3D space without device anchor errors
